# robo
 This repository contains a prototype for a robo-advisor risk profiling system. The project is designed to collect investor data, preprocess it, and use a machine learning model to classify investors into risk categories (Conservative, Moderate, or Aggressive). This is the first step towards building a full-featured robo-advisor that provides personalized investment recommendations.
